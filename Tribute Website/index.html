					    Many people will remeber Tracey Lynn Brown for her fiery spirit and ready smile. Her father affectionately called her "friendly friendly" as she seldom met a stranger. The middle daughter of Thelma and Robert Brown, she was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1965. Always ready for a good laugh and fun activity, Tracey participated in numerous auxiliary groups and grade school sporting clubs.<br>
						<br>

						She left home in 1984 to attend her beloved home by the sea, Hampton University. Tracey later enlisted in the Navy Reserves where she proudly serverd her country for more than 15 years as a Petty Officer. The many trips abroad training with the Navy incited within Tracey a passion to see the world. In addition to her passion for traveling, she wasd devoted educator within the Virginia Public School and Detroit Public School systems. In 2002, she completed her master in Education from Cambridge College. Tracey often motivated her student to push harder so they could go further in life, and to always remember to give back to their commmuntiy.<br>
						<br>

						The only thin Tracey loved more than traveling the world and teaching was her family. Having several counsins, and friends that she adopted as family, Tracey spent many summers sharing laughs and creating memories with those that meant the most to her.<br>
						<br>

						She was an active member for Frist Baptist Insitutional Church, and Vice President of the National Hampton Alumni Association(Detroit Chapter). She leaves behind two children, Gregory B. Shavers Jr and Tracey L Shaver Jr., her parents Robert and Thelma Brown, two sisters, Criss Jackson( Robert Jackson), Robin Howard(Troy Howard) in addition to nieces and nephews Ryan Duncan, Hailie Howard and Tory A. Howard and a grand dog Obama Shavers.<br>
						<br>

						Tracey was a light that loved to help others shine and will be dearly missed.<br>
